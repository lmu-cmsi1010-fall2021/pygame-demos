# Python Game Demos
This repository contains a collection of code and resources to play with for creating games with Python. The originals for these files are taken from various public locations across the web, and are collated here in one place for your convenience.

## Overview
The files in this repository represent different ways for implementing games in Python. They vary based on the Python library that they use:

| Base library | Examples |
|----|----|
| Tkinter | [tkinter_demo.py](./tkinter_demo.py), [all_user_input_widgets.py](./all_user_input_widgets.py) |
| Graphics | [tetris_sol.py](./tetris_sol.py) |
| Pillow | [whack_a_mole.py](./whack_a_mole.py) |
| PyGame | `chimp`, [test_pygame.py](./test_pygame.py) |

Tkinter serves as a foundation for any Python program that has graphicsâ€”you have already been using this via the _graphics.py_ module that has come with many of your psets! The included Tkinter-only demos arenâ€™t really games; they show you how to open a window and how to code up basic widgets like buttons, lists, text fields, etc.

Graphics is the trusty _graphics.py_ module that has come with many of your psets so far. As you might recall, this module adds a number of basic computer graphics operations. If you put these together in the right way, you can implement games! However, _graphics.py_ does not include support for music or other sound ðŸ˜”

Another area where Tkinter can use a boost is support for image files. The [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org) library helps here, making it easier to implement game graphics based on image files that you can create separately.

Finally, the most broad-based basic game support can be found by installing the [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org) Python library. Learning this library can give you a path toward creating Python games with the least possible boilerplate code, with support for images, music, and sound built-in.

These four are all independent alternatives to creating game-like programs in Python. If you prefer to stay with something you have used before and donâ€™t mind not having music or sound, staying with _graphics.py_ will suffice. If you want to learn just enough additional code to handle images, you can use Pillow. However if you want all of the above _plus_ music/sound, and are willing to learn some new library code, PyGame would be the way to go.

## Required Library: PyGame
PyGame is a Python library that is not included with most standard installations of Python. As such, it needs to be installed separately. There are many ways to install a Python library so if you know of others and prefer those, feel free to use them. If you are new to installing third-party libraries, _pip_ with the `user` option is a safe way to do so: the `user` option ensures that the library is saved as part of _your_ user accountâ€™s files, avoiding administrator passwords and possible interference with operating system files.

### Windows

    py â€“m pip install â€“U pygame -user

### macOS

    python3 â€“m pip install â€“U pygame --user

If the exact command doesnâ€™t appear to work, try to replace `py` or `python3` with the Python command youâ€™ve been using.

## Quick Start: `chimp`
If you want to try something out right away, the PyGame library comes with a built-in example called `chimp`. In fact, you donâ€™t need _any_ extra code to run it; itâ€™s already in PyGame! Do this:

    python3 â€“m pygame.examples.chimp

(substitute `python3` with your Python command if itâ€™s different)

An article on how `chimp` works can be found here: https://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/ChimpLineByLine.html

The code for `chimp` can be seen here: https://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/chimp.py.html

## Set Yourself Up for Experimentation
If you want to modify and push your modifications to GitHub, you will need to _fork_ this repository. This will create your own personal copy which you can then clone as usual. Click on _Fork_ button near the top-right of https://github.com/lmu-cmsi1010-fall2021/pygame-demos in order to create a forked copy for yourself.

## Required Library for Whack-a-Mole Demo: Pillow
If you would like to play with the Whack-a-Mole demo, you will need an additional library called Pillow. Installing it via _pip_ with the `user` option is similar to PyGame; just change the library name.

### Windows

    py â€“m pip install â€“U Pillow -user

### macOS

    python3 â€“m pip install â€“U Pillow --user
